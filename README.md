# Python Project for Data Science

## Summary: 

This project is part of the IBM course *Python Project for Data Science*. It's designed to help us apply and expand the foundational Python skills we learned in *Python for Data Science, AI & Development*. The focus is on data extraction and web scraping, using the `yfinance` and `BeautifulSoup` modules. Through this hands-on project, we are able to work with historical stock and revenue data, analyze it, and create a dashboard. Itâ€™s a great way to put our knowledge to use and take one step closer to real-world project experience!

## Objective:

1. Extract stock data using two methods:
   - Using the `yfinance` library
   - Web scraping with the `BeautifulSoup` library
2. Create and display a visually appealing graph

## Stock Graph:
